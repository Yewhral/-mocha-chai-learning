# -mocha-chai-learning

This repository is my introduction to true unit testing with Mochajs and Chaijs.

Adding those two to my skillset will definitely make me a better developer.

Unit testing is way easier than I thought it will be. It will require slightly different code from me, but hey, nothing's hard here!
